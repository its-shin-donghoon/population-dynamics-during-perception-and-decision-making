Run the LFADS algorithm on an Steinmetz Neuropixel dataset of mice during two alternative forced choice (2-AFC) visual discrimination task.
This [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/125PV8YehFf4hoqJUwfNWVSjip2HqKmIW?usp=sharing) does the following:

1. Download the Steinmetz dataset. (Steinmetz et al. 2019 Nature)
2. Install & run LFADS. (Pandarinath et al. 2018. Nature Methods)
3. Save learned LFADS parameters.
4. Plot Some figures.

This project was a group project for Neuromatch Academy, 2020. The notebook is an adjusted form of Computation from dynamics and Neuromatch, steinmetz dataset.
