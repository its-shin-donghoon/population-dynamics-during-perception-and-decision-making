Run the LFADS algorithm on an Steinmetz Neuropixel dataset of mice during two alternative forced choice (2-AFC) visual discrimination task.
This notebook does the following:

Download the Steinmetz dataset. (Steinmetz et al. 2019 Nature)
Install & run LFADS. (Pandarinath et al. 2018. Nature Methods)
Save learned LFADS parameters.
Plot Some figures.
This project was a group project for Neuromatch Academy, 2020. The notebook is an adjusted form of Computation from dynamics and Neuromatch, steinmetz dataset.

This notebook was verified with Google Colab.
